GNARQL Audio Collection Aggregator
----------------------------------


INSTALL:

 * Make sure you have SWI-Prolog installed
   
   http://www.swi-prolog.org

   Make sure you have the SemWeb package
   installed

   http://www.swi-prolog.org/packages/semweb.html

 * That's it!


RUN:

 * Launch start.pl (modify the header of the script
   if your prolog install is elsewhere than in /usr/local)
 * That's it!

USE:

Now, here are the things that you can do. GNARQL exposes 
a set of URI, that can be used to drive it.

First, you'll need to load a GNAT'ed audio collection (GNAT
is a tool that drops some little RDF files throughout 
your music collection, linking its items towards corresponding
identifiers out there on the Web, you can download it at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/motools/).

 * http://localhost:3021/load?path=/path/to/your/collection&base=http://base_uri/

   The "path" parameter holds the path to your audio collection, and the
   optional "base" parameter holds a base_uri (in case your collection is also served
   through HTTP, and you want HTTP identifiers to be in use, for example)

 * http://localhost:3021/reload

   If your collection has been modified, or if you just GNAT'ed some 
   new items, this will get through previously loaded collections
   and look for modifications.

 * http://localhost:3021/make

   This will reload every previously loaded/crawled changed RDF files.

Now we ingested some raw information about our audio collection, let's aggregate
some data about it!

 * http://localhost:3021/crawl/init?n=10

   This will init 10 crawlers. The "n" parameter is the number of crawlers to be
   instantiated.

 * http://localhost:3021/crawl/start

   This will launch the crawling process. Note that it should resume
   fine (if you stop your GNARQL or in case of crash).


========================================


At any time, you can query the GNARQL instance through the SPARQL end-point at:

There is also a Web interface available at:
