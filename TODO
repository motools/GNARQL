* BUG : Currently expand_file_path in load.pl falls over when WildCard (eg. a folder path) contains a $ sign.
* BUG : Bad handling of UTF-8. Falls over if env var $LANG is blank (as it is on the cluster by default). Setting LANG="en_GB.UTF-8" lets it continue through, but there are encoding errors :/
* WTF : For some reason, loading in previously parsed RDF files takes significantly (~50x) longer than parsing them for the first time :/
